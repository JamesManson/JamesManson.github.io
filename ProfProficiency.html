        <h3 id="H3SpacingFromTop"><strong>Communication</strong> </h3>
        <p>Good communication within our group had a major impact on the overall progress of our software project. Being agile in the way we executed each sprint was heavily reliant on the knowledge of what other members of the group were working on, and
            which user stories were agreed upon to be prioritized for that week. </p>
        <p>Inside of class, we would always start the session by discussing what each team member had been working on since we had last met. We would then look back to our KANBAN board and close any open tickets that had now been completed, and would issue
            new user stories to each member depending on what strengths each person had to match the required task. </p>
        <p>Outside of class, the group were able to take an application such as Discord, primarily used for multiplayer gaming, and adapt to its functionality as a tool we could use for our project. It's instant messaging system was simplistic and easy to
            use, as well as its file sharing system being very helpful whenever a group member needed to upload Php code, gitlab files or even links to websites that could help with learning the Yii framework used in our project.</p>
        <p>One of the most important aspects of communication between the group, was the ability to quickly adapt to the changes of the requirements for the project. During scrums inside of class, discussion with the project manager (Elise) would sometimes
            bring up new user stories that would affect the work flow of the group. Most of the time the newly introduced requirements would have higher priority over other tasks currently being worked on, so it was important for us as a group to communicate
            with each other to work in the most efficient way possible to deliver working software on time for the end of sprints.</p>
        <h3><strong>Leadership</strong> </h3>
        <p>The term leadership when applied to an agile approach to group work, is the ability to take charge in quickly changing circumstances. Without this skill, the overall performance of the team and final delivered software quality will be negatively
            impacted.</p>
        <p>Critical thinking was a major part of our groups success as this was what made the group agile in the way we could approach the work load. The ability to determine strengths of team members and assign relative work that would be easiest for that
            specific person, or group of people, was how we were able to keep a continuous work flow. It was the responsibility of all team members to deliver working software and this was made easy by having the leadership skills necessary to perform
            well.</p>
        <h3><strong>Team Work</strong></h3>
        <p>Because some group members such as myself were completely new to the Php language, team work was extremely helpful. Throughout the project group members were willing to share their knowledge and experience with other members which was very encouraging
            to see. If anyone was struggling or falling behind we would offer each other help with the required task in order to maintain a good level of work output. </p>
        <p>As number 4 of the Agile Manifesto States - "Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project". Our group showed this principle in our ability to work as a team to provide a working Semester Tracking software at the
            end of the semester. I believe without a good understanding on how important team work can be in a group project, we would not have been as efficient with the completion of tickets each sprint and overall our performance would suffer if we
            had of relied on individual work.</p>
        <h3><strong>Time Management</strong></h3>
        <p>Time management in this software project referred to how we operated in each sprint. Making sure we were as efficient as possible with work output came from prioritizing which user stories were major, and which were minor. By doing this we made
            sure that we were putting the effort into the areas that counted most, such as core features eg. Semester Dates, Login System, Database. </p>
        <p>To avoid any overlapping of work, communication through discord and scrums was key. Everyone always knew their required task and how long they had in order to complete it before the next sprint.</p>
        <p>"Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale" - Number 3 of the Agile Manifesto. Our highest priority as a group was to make sure we had a new version of software
            to release at the end of each sprint. Having core functionality was heavily prioritized over smaller features were less important. So managing our time well was key in the success of the Semester Tracker.</p>
        <h3><strong>Motivation</strong> </h3>
        <p>Like any good team, motivation is what people need to succeed. Whenever somebody had completed a key feature needed in the software, the group would always tell them "good job" and "well done". Making others feel comfortable and giving them a
            sense of belonging in the group was our motivation towards team members. People will always work best when they are congratulated for contributing to their team.</p>
        <p id="PProfFromBottom">However self-motivation is also just as important when working individually at home or when struggling to complete a task. For me I had been working on the login system for at least 3 weeks, and for me the hardest thing was not giving up. Because
            I had never used the Php language before I found it extremely difficult to understand why certain things were not working. But staying motivated enough to not give up on the task I was able to seek help from other team members and once I had
            understood why it was not working, I felt a great sense of achievement, and with that I was motivated to continue to contribute to my team.</p>
